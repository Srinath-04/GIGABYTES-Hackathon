# Kumarans OpenHack 2021 - Team GIGABYTES
# Our app aims to help people amidst the pandemic, even with minor issues that pick their brain
# Users can choose (future implementation) anonymous aliases, which aims to build confidence and increase openness

# code uses Users.csv as a data storaging file, which is updated by the python files (future implementation)
# UI is a mixture of 'pygame' and 'tkinter' bringing out the best of both worlds
# Individual UI codes sends data back to the outer pythin file, which transfers said data to the new UI
# Due to lack of time, the code could not be integrated; however files fully function induvidually
